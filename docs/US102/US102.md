# US102


## Decision Making

* Still talking about the US101 and linking to the US102, during the creation, we
had the talk about creating 3 AVL for the 3 different types of unique codes, the
mmsi, imo and callsign, but we choose only creating one, opting for the mmsi
to be the ordering factor in the AVL, so we donâ€™t have triplicated information
in the system, although the search by the other 2 unique attributes is not so
efficient.
