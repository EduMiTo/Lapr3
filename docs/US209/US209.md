# US209


## Decision Making

* First, we create a cursor to iterate through all the Manifests positions of a given boat that is received by parameter, and in each iteration, we check if there is any TRIP in which the date received by parameter, is contained in the departure date and arrival date. If yes, we count the containers in that particular PHASE and its superior ones, because if the containers are leaving in step 2 they are present in step 1, dividing the final value by the boat capacity to get the percentage. The reasoning used for the percentage calculation was the same as for the previous US, only changing in the date verification, which led to not using it directly.
