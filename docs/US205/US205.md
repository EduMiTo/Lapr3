# US205


## Decision Making

* First, we create a cursor to iterate through all the Position Manifests for a given boat. For the next port to exist, then the manifest job of that ship has to be active, that is, it has more stops, so, to check if the manifest job was finished or not we compare the number of TRIPS with the number of Manifest Job Unload, that is, the number of trips has to be equal to the number of unloads, since a manifest job has several trips and in each trip it has to unload something in the respective destination port of the trip. If this number is not equal, the first time this condition is detected it means that it is the oldest active manifest post on the boat, that is, the one that dictates the boat's original route, so it will set the "next port". The "next port" is defined by checking how many Unload manifest posts exist, so we will know which is the last port where it stopped. Knowing the last port where you stopped, the next port is the destination of the trip where the origin is the last port. With the "next port" now defined let's check in the several active Manifests all the ones that have their next port equal to the one previously defined, if yes, the request is printed.
