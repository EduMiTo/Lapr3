# US210


## Decision Making

* As this User Story asks to list all the boats that are available and their respective position, we first create a cursor to iterate over all the boats and after that another cursor to iterate over all the Manifests positions of each iterated boat. After having the cursors created, using the NEXT_DAY function, we can find out which is the next Monday to be counted by the system date. Next, we check for each manifest job of each boat if the expected date to finish its final TRIP is less than the date obtained by the NEXT_DAY function used earlier, if this happens is because the boat, in principle, because the date is expected, is available in the manifest job in question. If all the manifest positions for that boat meet the requirements mentioned above, we will search all the positions Manifests in the boat for the one with the closest end date to next Monday and its respective position. If the boat has no associated manifest positions, the User Story will list the boat's most recent position.
