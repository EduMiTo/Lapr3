## Decision Making

* Explaining the essentials of the relational model, when a ship is in a port and is loading something for transportation, a manifest load job is generated. This manifest Load job will have its route defined in the "trip" table, and the manifest Load job will have many trips. Whenever a "trip" ends, an Unload manifest job is generated, and for there to be a trip to that destination is because the ship had to unload something there. If in the middle of the trip the ship has to load something, a new manifest load job is generated, but, following our reasoning about this business, this new manifest load job can only contain routes that the first generated manifest load job contains, so as not to make the ship change the planned route since it left the initial port. Since a container can be in several manifest Load jobs and a manifest Load job contains several containers, then a table is generated according to this "many many many" connection. With this table, knowing one manifest load job, we know all the containers it has loaded and knowing only the container, we can know all the manifest load jobs it has been in. More specific points about the relational model, used throughout the resolution of the US, will be explained in the appropriate US.
